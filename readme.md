# Pathfinder

## How do I run this?

### Requirements to run test

You will need to utilize postman and access the following endpoints
`127.0.0.1:8080/reset_and_pop_db`
and
`127.0.0.1:8080/schedule/FIGTEST`

### Requirements to run api

You will need to download and install postgres and create a `.env` file in the API project like shown in `.env.example`.

## Where's the good stuff?

### Schemas n all

The postgres table creations are located in `/api/migrations.`
The diesel schemas are in `/api/schema.rs` with relevant handlers in `/api/handlers.` and models in `/api/models/`

### Internally used structs

Most of these can be found in `/api/handlers/types.rs`, with some internally used structs in `/api/handlers/schedule.rs`.

### Recursion problems

Located in `/api/handlers/schedule.rs`

Catalog is hardcoded in `/api/handlers/catalog.rs`

## dev commands (unused at the moment)
